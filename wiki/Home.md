Welcome to the TETRA-BlueStation Wiki. This is a FOSS TETRA stack aimed at providing an extensible basis for TETRA experimentation and research. 

The following Wiki is structured as follows: 
* **Introduction**: lists all working details, implementation choices, working and non-working features
* **Requirements**: summarizes the supported hardware, and legal considerations
* **Dependencies and building**: goes through the dependencies install process as well as install procedure
* **Configuration**: explains how to properly configure tetra-bluestation for execution
* **Running TETRA-BlueStation**: lists the steps to start tetra-bluestation and how to improve execution


> ⚠️ **Experimental Software Warning**
>
> *tetra-bluestation* is **highly experimental** software.
>
> - Interfaces, features, and internal behavior may change at any time.
> - Things **will break** occasionally, sometimes in creative ways.
> - New features and bug fixes are added frequently.
> - Documentation and wiki content may **lag behind the current code** and should not be assumed to be fully up to date.
>
> This project is intended for experimentation, research, and learning.  
> Do not rely on it for production use, safety-critical systems, or operational networks.
>
> If you encounter unexpected behavior, consult the source code and recent commits first, and feel free to report issues or contribute improvements.
