# Contributing to the tetra-bluestation project
Contributions are very welcome. Contributors are encouraged to discuss ideas early, especially for larger or more invasive changes. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures alignment with the project’s long-term technical direction.

Forks of **encouraged** and play an important role in experimentation, innovation, and rapid prototyping. They allow contributors to explore new ideas, integrations, and workflows without being constrained by the stability requirements of the main project.

That said, code originating from forks is not automatically supported or endorsed by the core BlueStation project. Fork-based features may be incomplete, experimental, non-standard, or insufficiently validated for long-term operation.

Before any forked functionality is merged into the main codebase, it must undergo careful analysis, review, and testing. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Protocol correctness and standards compliance  
- Architectural fit within the existing codebase  
- Runtime stability and failure modes  
- Security and network impact  
- Long-term maintainability

The preferred contribution model is to submit **limited-scope, focused pull requests** rather than large feature drops. Smaller, well-defined changes are easier to review, test, and refine, and significantly increase the likelihood of successful integration.

This approach ensures that BlueStation remains reliable while still evolving through community contributions.


# Issues and Bug Reports

Issues are the primary mechanism for reporting bugs, requesting enhancements, and tracking work.

A structured issue template is provided in the repository. Contributors are strongly encouraged to use it and to fill it out as completely as possible.
Issues that lack sufficient detail may be difficult to act on and may be deferred until more information is available.

Constructive discussion and follow-up on issues is encouraged. Even partial reports or observations can be valuable, as long as they are clearly marked as such.

# Wiki Contributions

Contributions to this wiki are welcome and encouraged. Improving documentation helps lower the barrier to entry, reduces repeated questions, and improves overall project quality.

## Contributing to the Wiki

If you wish to contribute to this wiki:

1. Fork the main tetra-bluestation-docs repository  
2. Clone your fork locally  
3. Make your documentation changes in the repository  
4. Submit a pull request  

All wiki content is sourced from the main repository to ensure review, versioning, and traceability.

## Notes for Contributors with Wiki Write Access

> **Please do not edit this wiki directly.**

Even if you have write access to the GitHub Wiki, direct edits should be avoided.

Instead:
- Commit documentation changes to the main repository
- Let the GitHub Action automatically update and publish the wiki content

This workflow ensures:
- Consistent review via pull requests  
- A clear change history  
- A way to make contributions possible without giving a public, unckecked wiki access
- Automatic synchronization between repository and wiki
